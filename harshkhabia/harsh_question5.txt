push --force
when we use force it will overwrite all the history forcly and we lose previous changes.

push --force-with-lease
when we do some changes and need to append it with new one, it is a good practice to use force with lease 

force with lease is used when
	- we have to squash some commits together into one
	- we have changed author for commits previously
	- we have changed the order of commits
